CSS/JS:
      - Add dropdown menus for mobile version. @media max-width 767 and below should include smaller menus,
        with the option to hide them.  
          > So, for global menu, hamburger logo button. 
          > And for Lectures, have a 'Lectures' button - when clicked, will show all lectures.
      - Lectures menu could also be thinner - 60%. Keep it left aligned, and allow that drop down.



DONE----Mobile: FIX : Lecture width and images allow zooming out. Limit size
DONE----Actual lecture content is fine on mobile, looks good.
